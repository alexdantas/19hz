![title screen](http://19hz.alexdantas.net/images/title.png)

[This game was made for the 2013 Global Game Jam][ggj-game].
The idea is to make teams all over the world create games based
on a concept. That year, the concept was *hearbeat sounds*.

The whole development cycle lasted 48 hours on the Jam Site
[GameDev-DF][gamedev], finishing by Monday, January 28, 2013.

Here's the [old GitHub repository][old].

## Usage

For Windows systems, [download the executable here][windows-exe]
and run `19.exe`.

For GNU/Linux systems, the following should build and run
the program:

    $ make
	$ ./19hz --state StateFirst
